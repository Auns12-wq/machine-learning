# machine-learning
<span style="color:skyblue">
 Machine Learning is a subset of AI that focuses on the development of algorithms and 
statistical models that enable computers to learn and make predictions or decisions without 
being explicitly programmed. ML systems learn from data, identify patterns, and make 
predictions or take actions based on that learning.

### SUPERVIZED LEARNING
---

In supervised learning, the algorithm is 
trained on labeled data, where each data 
point is associated with a known target or 
output value. The algorithm learns to map 
inputs to outputs based on the provided 
examples. It can then make predictions or 
classify new, unseen data.



### UNSUPERVIZED LEARNING
---
Unsupervised learning involves training the 
algorithm on unlabeled data, where there are 
no predefined output labels or targets. The 
algorithm aims to discover patterns, 
structures, or relationships in the data.

### REINFORCEMENT LEARNING
---
Reinforcement learning involves an agent 
interacting with an environment and learning 
from feedback in the form of rewards or 
penalties. The agent learns by taking 
actions and receiving feedback on the quality 
of those actions. The goal is to 
maximize cumulative rewards over time.
